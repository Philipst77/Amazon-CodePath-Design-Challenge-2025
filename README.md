# 🍽️ Lambda Forge — Amazon x CodePath Next Design Challenge 2025

Welcome to **Lambda Forge’s** official project for the **Amazon x CodePath Design Challenge** (Summer 2025).  
This year’s theme is:

> **“From Pixel to Plate: Innovating Food Accessibility”**

---

## 🧠 Challenge Overview
The goal of this design challenge is to tackle issues related to **food access, food security**, and **cultural connection through food** using **technology** and **human-centered design**.

Teams are encouraged to identify underserved communities, research their pain points, and develop thoughtful, scalable solutions that make nutritious food more accessible, affordable, or culturally inclusive.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Millions of college students in urban and suburban areas experience **food insecurity** due to:
- Lack of time or transportation to get groceries
- Limited access to healthy, affordable food near campus
- Cultural barriers when accessing traditional food pantries

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We're building **MealLink**, a mobile-first web platform that:
- Connects students with **free/discounted prepared meals** from local restaurants, dining halls, and campus fridges  
- Features **pickup/delivery scheduling** that integrates with student availability  
- Uses **AI-based personalization** to recommend meals that match dietary and cultural preferences  
- Builds community by allowing students to **donate, reserve, or share meals** within their network
